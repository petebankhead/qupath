# Default is English, so don't need any customization.

# This file still needs to exist to avoid unexpected behavior when
# - the *display* locale is English
# - the *default* locale is not English, but does support localized strings
#
# In this (obscure, not-recommended) scenario, the display locale would be 
# ignored and the strings from the default locale used instead if we didn't
# have this empty English properties file.
